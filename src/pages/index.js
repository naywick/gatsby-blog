        <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
        <p>
          I am a software developer working primarily in Ruby on Rails, though I also dabble in some JavaScript/TypeScript. I'm proud to work at <a href="https://www.patchwork.health/">Patchwork Health</a> helping the NHS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also write and was shortlisted for the <a href="https://bricklanebookshop.org/2021-short-story-prize/">Brick Lane Bookshop Short Story Prize</a>. When I am not writing code, I write regular words and am currently working on a novel about two women from my native Sri Lanka.
